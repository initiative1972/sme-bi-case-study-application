# Virtual Machine (VM) Exercises

## :information_source: Read this before getting started
- The goal of exercises in case study is for learners to apply what was learned in the previous courses to new problems or situations. This is best pedagogical practice for retaining and building skills.
- We can only run free versions of BI software in our virtual machine exercises. In the case of Power BI, make sure the exercises can run on [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/) without any additional paid products. 
- Unsure what the scope of an exercise should be? Here's an [example](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/case-study-analyzing-customer-churn-in-tableau/exploratory-analysis-1?ex=4) from the Case Study: Analyzing Customer Churn in Tableau. The first chapter of most DataCamp courses are free, so take a look at our [BI courses](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses?technologies=Tableau&technologies=Power%20BI) to get a feel for how we assess and guide learners in **case studies**.

## 1st VM Exercise

#### Dataset

- [ ] Add datasets used to the `datasets/` folder

#### Files

- [ ] **Initial**: Add file to the `exercises/`  folder with the name `ex-1-intial.twbx` or `ex-1-intial.pbix`, depending if you are auditioning for a Tableau or Power BI course.
- [ ] **Solution**: Add file to the `exercises/`  folder with the name `ex-1-sol.twbx` or `ex-1-sol.pbix`

#### Learning Objective

Learn how to build an interactive scatter plot by applying the skill of controlling sets with parameters.

#### Context

You're nominated as BI specialist by the board to make a presentation on the 1000 startups and support well-informed decision on which to invest based on the criteria of high revenue, low expense, and top growth.

#### Steps to be executed by the student (max 6)

*Each bulleted instruction is a complete sentence that describes a specific task.*

- Step 1: Create parameter of Revenue Cutoff
- Step 2: Create parameter of Expenses Cutoff
- Step 3: Create parameter of Growth Leaders
- Step 4: Create set of High Revenue
- Step 5: Create set of Low Expenses
- Step 6: Build an interactive scatter plot with controllable parameters of Revenue Cutoff and Expenses Cutoff
#### Exercise question:
After you finish building the interactive scatter plot, select different values of Expense Cutoff and Revenue Cutoof on the slide bar to see how the scatter plot changes correspondingly.
